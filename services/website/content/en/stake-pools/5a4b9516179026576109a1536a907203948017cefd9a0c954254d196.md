# Our Mission:

The mission of our pool is to onboard as many people from the streets as possigle.
To achieve this we are going to build a Cardano Demo Platform in Testnet, where it is easy and
free of monetary risk for newcomers, to find our what this technology can offer, how safe it is and also 
how easy it is to use. This way we hope to onboard even the most scared user. 
And maybe even your grandmother ;)
