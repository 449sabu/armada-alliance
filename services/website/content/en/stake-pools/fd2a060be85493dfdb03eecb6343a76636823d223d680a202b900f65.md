### About RADAR

[RADAR](https://radarstakepool.org) is a Mission Driven Pool that donates 10% of our profits to [Coin Center](https://coincenter.org), the leading non-profit cryptocurrency advocacy group.  We need to support sensible regulatory approaces to encourage continued cryptocurrency innovation for projects like Cardano. We also are passionate about assuring the future of cryptocurrency is energy-efficient and affordable in a way that proof-of-work models can never be.  The majority of our pool is run on Rasberry-Pi's that require minimal start up cost and an incredibly low energy-requirement to run.

We were the happy recipients of a 15 million ADA Cardano Foundation grant in Q3 of 2021 which has allowed us to test and streamline our pool to be be as efficient and prepared as possible to mint blocks 24/7.  We made them $200K ADA in the time they were with us, and we are waiting for your delegation to make you money on your investment as well!  

RADAR is a proud member of the [Armada Alliance](https://armada-alliance.com/) and [Cardano Mission Driven Pools](https://www.missiondrivenpools.org/)
