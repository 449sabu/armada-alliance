The Fat Frog Cardano Stake Pool is a single pool operator (SPO). Our primary goal is to promote True Decentralization for the Cardano blockchain.

We plan to continually invest the fixed fee we generate each epoch to upgrade our systems and add additional relays to maximize our pool's block-producing capability, speed and efficiency.
