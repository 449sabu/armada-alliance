### The pool

BeADA stake pool is a Belgian Cardano stake pool, hosted at home on our own energy efficient servers powered by solar power. 
This ensures true decentralisation, security and access to our pool, with all the values that are at the heart of Cardano.



### The mission

As beekeepers, we support our environment and educate others in the importance of bees for our ecosystem and food supply.
Keeping bees, educating our community and training aspiring beekeepers is a very rewarding mission!
