# About STOIC

STOIC Pool is an Eco-Friendly Pool running out of London in the UK off 100% Solar Power!

We have a small YouTube cahnnel where we share updates on the Pool every Epoch to keep delegators up to date with the pool performance, and we also share tutorials on tools in the Cardano Ecosystem.

STOIC is currently working on a top secret Catalyst proposal which will be applying for funding in the coming weeks for Fund 7.

The proposal wll be based on creating real world utility for the Cardano Blockchain beyond DeFi and NFTs!
