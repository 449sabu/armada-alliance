## Why using docker image to run a Cardano node?

The elegant aspect about deploying a Cardano node as a Docker image is that it can be installed seamlessly and launched out of the box. 
If you ever decide to remove it, you only have to delete one file - the image. Another advantage is that the created image can run on any 
operating system where Docker is installed. Using Docker reduces the complexity and effort of setting up a Cardano node compared to the 
traditional way (for example, you don't have to deal with systemd settings).

**The docker image includes all necessary tools to run and monitor a Cardano node:**
1. cardano-node & cardano-cli v1.34.1 - Cardano binaries to run the node (Download compiled binaries from [Armada Alliance GitHub](https://github.com/armada-alliance/cardano-node-binaries)) 
2. gLiveView - Monitoring tool for the Cardano node
3. ScheduledBlocks - Tool to query the scheduled slots for a block production node. (Credits for this tool goes to [SNAKE POOL](https://github.com/asnakep/ScheduledBlocks))
4. Cardano Submit Transaction API - API to connect with a Cardano wallet (e.g. Nami) to send transactions via your own full node
