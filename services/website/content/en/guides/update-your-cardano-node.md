## Updating your Cardano node

- It is common practice as a Stake pool operator to update your [Cardano node](/en/terms/cardano-node.md) to the latest version to ensure your pool remains online and performs as expected. We have a guide to help you update your [Raspberry Pi](/en/identities/raspberrypi.md), MacMini, or other ARM based Cardano node. 


Here is a nice video to help you update your node as well.
