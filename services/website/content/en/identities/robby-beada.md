Hi there, let me introduce myself.
In my pool I'm combining 2 large aspects of my life, Cardano and beekeeping.
Beekeeping started as a hobby, but turned into a passion. It's very rewarding working with bees, and educating others about bees and their importance and benefit to our environment.
I educate people that want to learn more, and help people that want to start beekeeping themselves.
My Cardano journey started with Charles Hoskinson's whiteboard video, and that let me down the rabbit hole all the way to starting my own stakepool!
It's philisophy and community is what I value most about it.
