Hi, my name is Jorge Sobenes (aka George). I am the Stake Pool Operator of VELA Pool [VELA]. I created VELA as I believe that the Cardano Blockchain can be a new financial system where we can cut the middle man, facilitate access to capital, secure information, speed up country development and modernize the states.  I wanted to be part of it.

I have a passion for technology, macroeconomics, people's freedom and, I found in Cardano, a space where I can combine those 3.

I completed my studies at the Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Valparaíso, a B.S. in Electronics Engineering and a MBA from Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Santiago. I live in Viña del Mar, Chile, and I work in Broadcast Engineering as the Latam Sales Manager for a Canadian company. I spend my day Working/Biking/Running/Swimming/Learning & Barbecuing with friends and family during the weekends.
