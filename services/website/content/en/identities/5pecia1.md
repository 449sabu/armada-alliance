Hi I am 5pecia1. In 2017, I started studying blockchain with Bitcoin and Ethereum, and since 2018, I have been using Hyperledger Fabric to develop a full blockchain stack(blockchain-backend-frontend) in enterprise and contribute to blockchain open source.
I have the skills and soon I will have time. I will leave the company :)
Now I want to work for Cardano and the blockchain ecosystem.
If you support me, please stake my pool.
Thank you.
