Hi, I'm Sully, the operator of RADAR stake pool.  Long time Cardano-enthusiast.  Finally began a stake pool in March, 2021.  To help decentralization, I was drawn to using the cheapest, most energy-efficinet means of running a node, so that led me to the Armada Alliance to help streamline ways for affordable nodes to be a possibility for almost anyone.  RADAR also is a Mission Driven Pool, donating 10% of our profit to Coin Center, the leading non-profit crypto-advocacy group educating policy makers to help steer regulation that encourages cryptocurrency invoation.
