Hi, I'm Token, founder and SPO of Token Stake Pool.
My journey with cryptocurrencies began on 2011, trading p2p and mining Bitcoin on low-powered devices, such as Raspberry Pi + Satoshi Block Erupters.

Degrees: Electronics Engineer, MSc. in Computer Science

Research interests: artificial intelligence, computer vision, robotics, deep reinforcement learning, embedded Linux and electronics.

I'd be glad to help the next generation of Cardano stake pool operators, roboticists and AI/ML/DRL practitioners.

Ticker: TOKEN
