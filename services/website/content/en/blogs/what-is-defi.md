Since the DeFi summer of 2020, one of the hottest topics discussed in the cryptocurrency and digital asset space is decentralized finance or DeFi. With massive growths in "total value locked" and active users of various protocols, we have seen a sort of crypto Gold Rush accompanied by a Wild West-style code of conduct. 

In DeFi, we see the great benefits of decentralization, unheard-of returns on investment, equal access to all users, and much more. But we also see the flip side of this financial freedom like scams, rug-pulls, insider trading, network outages, and hacks. Let's take a closer look into what DeFi is and why it is vital to the future success of cryptocurrencies and digital assets.

## What is DeFi?

Decentralized finance is the term to describe the collection of non-custodial decentralized financial services and the various protocols that operate them. The purpose of DeFi is simple, to bring equal access, fully transparent, and non-custodial financial services to anyone globally with an internet connection.

Much like traditional centralized financial services, DeFi has many use cases and helps create or maintain wealth for individuals by putting their assets to work. We will discuss them in greater detail later, but the most popular DeFi services offered are lending/borrowing, exchanges, options trading, derivatives, payments, and yield farming.

## Benefits of DeFi

Many problems exist with the conventional custodial financial services offered today that DeFi seeks to solve. 
- Unequal access to custodian financial services like bank accounts or lending/borrowing.
- Lack of access to financial services can prevent employment, generational wealth, homeownership, and more.
- Financial custodians can block payments at any time.
- Giving access to your private information to custodians to use as they see fit.
- Governments and centralized institutions can close down whole markets at will (AMC and GME stocks).
- Trading hours are often limited to business hours of a specific time zone.
- Money transfers and payments can take days to settle and often suffer from human error.
- Intermediaries or "middleman" cause custodian financial services to charge premiums just to use their service.

When we compare DeFi against the traditional financial system we can clearly see the benefits
